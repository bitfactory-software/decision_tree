## Why co_go::continuation?

Our product had its origin as a classic Windows application. In that envirionmet you can write great parts of the user interface in a sequetial manner via 'modal dialogs'. That looks like this:

```cpp
...
if (show_message_box("Continue?", {"Yes","No" }) != "Yes");
  return;
... // continue(!) with further processing
```

In more modern programming models, e.g. 'QML' this pattern changes to a 'callback' style like this:

```cpp
show_message_box("Continue?", {"Yes","No" }, [&](std::string_view choice){
    // continue(!) with further processing
    });
} // usualy the end of the function
```

What to do, when you want to port the logic written for windows style to an architecture, that requires a callback style, but you do not want to packk all the logic into callbacks? You need a **continuation**.
With that tool you can go like this:

```cpp
class abstract_message_box {
virtual co_go::continuation<std::string>
  show (std::string_view text, std::initializer_list<std::string_view> const& options) = 0; 
}
```
